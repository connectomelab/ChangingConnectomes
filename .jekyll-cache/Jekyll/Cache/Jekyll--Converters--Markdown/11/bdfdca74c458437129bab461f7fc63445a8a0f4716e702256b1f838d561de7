<p>Simulations of the strength of stimulation at the target region include <a href="https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/index.html">SIMNIBS</a> for non-invasive brain stimulation,  <a href="https://www.parralab.org/roast/">ROAST</a> for transcranial electrical stimulation, and <a href="http://www.k-wave.org/">k-wave</a> for ultrasound neuromodulation.</p>

<h3 id="simulating-the-effect-of-stimulation">Simulating the effect of stimulation</h3>
<p>There are several toolboxes to model the effects of brain stimulation: <a href="https://www.lead-dbs.org/">Lead-DBS</a> to model deep brain stimulation at the population level and <a href="https://github.com/connectomelab/Vertex_git">VERTEX</a> to model the effect of electrical stimulation at the neuronal level.</p>

<p>There are also models for <a href="https://github.com/ProjectPyRhO/PyRhO">optogenetic stimulation</a> and <a href="http://www.cando.ac.uk/publications/">closed-loop optogenetic stimulation</a>.</p>

<p>The example for neural population models in the book is available <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/showmodel.cshtml?model=226074#tabs-1">here</a>.</p>
