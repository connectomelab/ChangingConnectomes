<p>Code for parallel and serial axonal outgrowth, as described in [1], is available <a href="https://github.com/connectomelab/BICY_simul">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-time-windows">Multiple time windows</h3>
<p>Code for connection establishment following time windows, as described in [2], is available <a href="timewindows.zip">here</a>. The generated networks are available <a href="datasets.zip">here</a>. All scripts and functions are described in detail in the <a href="documentation.pdf">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Using multiple time windows, leading to heterochronous and spatially ordered neurodevelopmental gradients, Goulas and colleagues were able to reproduce brain connectivity patterns as observed in fly and human connectomes [3]. Their code is available <a href="https://github.com/AlGoulas/connectome-ontogenesis">here</a>.</p>
