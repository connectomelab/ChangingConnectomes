### Simulating the strength of stimulation at the target site
Simulations of the strength of stimulation at the target region include [SIMNIBS](https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/index.html) for non-invasive brain stimulation,  [ROAST](https://www.parralab.org/roast/) for transcranial electrical stimulation, and [k-wave](http://www.k-wave.org/) for ultrasound neuromodulation.

### Simulating the effect of stimulation
There are several toolboxes to model the effects of brain stimulation: [Lead-DBS](https://www.lead-dbs.org/) to model deep brain stimulation at the population level and [VERTEX](https://github.com/connectomelab/Vertex_git) to model the effect of electrical stimulation at the neuronal level. 

There are also models for [optogenetic stimulation](https://github.com/ProjectPyRhO/PyRhO) and [closed-loop optogenetic stimulation](http://www.cando.ac.uk/publications/).

The example for neural population models in the book is available [here](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/showmodel.cshtml?model=226074#tabs-1).
