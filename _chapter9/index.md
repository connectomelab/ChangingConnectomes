### Parallel and serial growth
Code for parallel and serial axonal outgrowth, as described in [1], is available [here](https://github.com/connectomelab/BICY_simul).


### Multiple time windows
Code for connection establishment following time windows, as described in [2], is available [here](timewindows.zip). The generated networks are available [here](datasets.zip). All scripts and functions are described in detail in the [documentation](documentation.pdf).

Using multiple time windows, leading to heterochronous and spatially ordered neurodevelopmental gradients, Goulas and colleagues were able to reproduce brain connectivity patterns as observed in fly and human connectomes [3]. Their code is available [here](https://github.com/AlGoulas/connectome-ontogenesis).
