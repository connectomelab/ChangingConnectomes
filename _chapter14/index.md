### Functional plasticity
Several mechanisms can be distinguished when discussing a change in synaptic weights. Many of these mechanisms are included in neural network simulators such as [NEURON](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neuron_simulation_environment), [GENESIS](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/GENESIS), [NEST](http://dx.doi.org/10.4249/scholarpedia.1430), [BRIAN](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Brian_simulator), or [VERTEX](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/VERTEX).


### Structural plasticity
Simulations for recovery after peripheral lesions are described in [1].


### Functional compensation
The approach of predicting which remaining brain region(s) could compensate for the loss of other brain regions is shown in [2].
