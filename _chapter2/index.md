There are various toolboxes for network analysis but the most widely used is the [Brain Connectivity Toolbox](http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net/). While being developed in Matlab, many functions are also available in C++. The toolbox contains a collection of complex network measures and large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity datasets.

Matlab code for generating hierarchical networks can be found [here](http://www.dynamic-connectome.org/pubs/suppl/Kaiser2010Frontiers.zip). These routines were used for the article Marcus Kaiser and Claus Hilgetag (2010). Optimal hierarchical modular topologies for producing limited sustained activation of neural networks. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics ([PDF](https://www.dynamic-connectome.org/pubs/Kaiser2010Frontiers.pdf))
