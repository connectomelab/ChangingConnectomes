### Accelerated growth
Routines for nonlinear growth [1], with each new node having a constant (absolute) number of connections or a relative (proportional) number of connections at the time of being added to the network [2].  

[absolute number, NLA](NLA_growth.m)

[proportional number, NLP](NLP_growth.m)
